Skin Disease Detection

📌 Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a Skin Disease Detection System built using Python, TensorFlow, EfficientNetB0, and Machine Learning Ensemble Models.
It analyzes skin images and predicts diseases such as:

Acne

Eczema

Psoriasis

Melanoma

Rosacea

Vitiligo

Seborrheic Dermatitis

Fungal Infections

The system also includes a Django web interface for uploading images and displaying predictions.


🚀 Features

Deep learning (EfficientNetB0) for feature extraction

Bilateral filtering + MixUp augmentation for improved accuracy

Ensemble model: Random Forest + XGBoost

Real-time prediction via a Django web app

User-friendly UI

MySQL database integration

Accuracy around 90%





#**Run Djnago Runsever :- python manage.py runserver**



📸 Usage

Open the web app

Upload a skin image

System processes and predicts the disease

Results shown with confidence score

💡 Hardware Integration (Optional)

Can be connected with:

ESP32 microcontroller

OV7670 camera module

ILI9341 TFT display

Images captured by ESP32 can be sent to Django via HTTP.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add vitamin level detection

Add mobile app

Improve dataset quantity

Add segmentation module
